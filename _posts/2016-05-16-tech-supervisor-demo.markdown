As 4ME is getting closer to its deployment, an essential component was missing from 4ME : a proper technical supervisor interface. The first iteration of this component is now ready and available on the [demo page]({{site.baseurl}}/demo/).

More issues have also been fixed throughout the whole stack.

[See full list]({% post_url 2016-05-16-tech-supervisor-demo %})
